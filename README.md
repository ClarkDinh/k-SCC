- This project is based upon work supported in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research/Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development (AAFOSR/AOARD) under award number FA2386-17-1-4046.
- It proposes an algorithm named k-SCC to estimate the number of clusters in categorical data clustering.
- The code is implemented in Python 3.6.
